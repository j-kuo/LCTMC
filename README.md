This R package has the implementation of our **latent class continuou-time Markov chain (CTMC)**, which was designed to cluster censored longitudinal categorical data based on the dynamic of the multistate process/trajectory. 

## Overview

Our model has been fully implemented, and two manuscripts have been drafted and are currently undergoing peer-review.

We will update this README once the manuscripts are published to ensure there are no issues with plagiarism. In the meantime, refer to the **['LCTMC.simulate'](https://github.com/j-kuo/LCTMC.simulate)** repository for further information on our latent class CTMC model.
