Description: Fits a latent class continuous-time Markov chain model for censored longitudinal binary and 3-category outcomes. This model utilizes the transition rates to move between levels of a categorical variable to perform latent clustering at the individual-level. Assuming that K latent classes exists among the population, each class is characterized by difference in magnitude of the baseline transition rates and the transition rate ratios. The 'LCTMC' package fits the model through via a direct optimization approach and also the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.
